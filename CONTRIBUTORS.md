## Grant information

The CLICS resource is the result of ongoing efforts which date back to
early 2013. Without the generous support of many different funding agencies, we
would not have been able to carry out this research. The table below lists, who
has profited during which time periods from what research projects awarded by
which funding agency.

## People

While the first CLICS database was based on three datasets alone, advanced approaches to data aggregation have enabled us to increase the number of different resources drastically. In order to lift these resources to the formats needed, people helped us in multiple ways, by linking languages to Glottolog (G), by mapping concepts to Concepticon (C), by writing the code to convert the data into the CLDF format (D), by digitizing resources for the CLICS database (Dig) by sharing their originally collected data with us (S), or by organizing workshops to teach how to add more data to CLICS (T).

For all this help, we are very grateful and express our gratitude.
