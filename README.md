# CLICS - The Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications

The original Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications ([CLICS](https://github.com/clics/clics1)), has
established a computer-assisted framework for the interactive
representation of cross-linguistic colexification patterns.
It has proven to be a useful tool for various kinds of
investigation into cross-linguistic semantic associations, ranging from
studies on semantic change, patterns of conceptualization, and
linguistic paleontology. But CLICS has also been criticized for obvious
shortcomings. Building on standardization efforts reflected in
the CLDF initiative and novel approaches for fast, efficient, and
reliable data aggregation, [CLICS²](https://github.com/clics/clics2) expanded the original CLICS database.
[CLICS³](https://github.com/clics/clics3) - the third installment of CLICS - exploits the framework pioneered in CLICS²
to more than double the amount of data aggregated in the database.
